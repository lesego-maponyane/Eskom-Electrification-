# âš¡ Eskom & Twitter Data Analysis (Python Predict Project)

This project explores **South African electrification data** and **Twitter service complaint data** using Python.  
It was structured as a function-based analysis notebook to showcase problem-solving, data cleaning, and predictive thinking.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
- Worked with two datasets:  
  1. **Electrification by Province (Eskom data)**  
  2. **Municipal Twitter complaints (Nov 2019)**  
- Implemented Python functions to:
  - Clean and preprocess raw data (remove commas, convert strings to integers)  
  - Map Twitter handles to municipalities  
  - Filter tweets, handle stopwords, and prepare text for analysis  
- Applied structured **function design** for reusability and testing.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Skills & Tools
- **Python** (functions, loops, string ops, dictionaries)  
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation  
- **Text preprocessing** (stopwords, cleaning)  
- **Data wrangling** (from raw CSVs into usable structures)  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why This Project Matters
- Showcases ability to work with **real South African datasets**  
- Demonstrates **clean coding practices** (functions, reusable code blocks)  
- Bridges **business insight + technical analysis** by linking electrification progress and public sentiment  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Outputs
- Clean electrification dataset (numeric by province)  
- Mapped dictionary of municipality Twitter handles  
- Preprocessed tweet samples (with stopwords removed)
